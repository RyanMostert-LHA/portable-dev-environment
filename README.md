# Portable Development Environment üöÄ

This repository contains everything you need to replicate a complete coding setup on any machine - choose from **Docker**, **WSL**, **Windows installer**, or **Virtual Machine** deployment options.

## üöÄ Installation

This repository now uses a unified installation script. To set up the environment, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/RyanMostert/portable-dev-environment.git
    cd portable-dev-environment
    ```

2.  **Run the installer:**
    ```bash
    bash scripts/install/install.sh
    ```

The script will detect your operating system and guide you through the installation process.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Before you start, you need to configure your environment.

1.  **Create a `.env` file** by copying the example file:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
2.  **Edit the `.env` file** and fill in the required values for `AI_CHAT_API_KEY`, `DEV_REPO_PATH`, etc.

This file is ignored by Git, so your secrets are safe.



## üê≥ Docker Setup (Recommended - Works on Any OS!)

### Quick Start

```bash
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 --name dev-env ryanmostert/portable-dev-environment:latest
```

Then open **http://localhost:8080** for VS Code in your browser!

### With Your Projects

```bash
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 \
  -v /path/to/your/projects:/home/developer/workspace/projects \
  --name dev-env ryanmostert/portable-dev-environment:latest
```

### Using Docker Compose (Best for Development)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RyanMostert/portable-dev-environment.git
cd portable-dev-environment
docker-compose up -d
```

Access VS Code at: **http://localhost:8080**

## üêß WSL Setup (Recommended for Windows)

Follow these steps to set up the environment in any WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) distribution.

### Step 1: Open Your WSL Terminal

First, open your WSL terminal on Windows. If you don't have WSL installed, run this command in an **Administrator** PowerShell and follow the prompts:
```powershell
wsl --install
```

### Step 2: Clone the Repository

Clone your repository from GitHub into your WSL home directory.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RyanMostert/portable-dev-environment.git
```

### Step 3: Navigate to the Project Directory

Change into the newly created directory.

```bash
cd portable-dev-environment
```

### Step 4: Configure Your Environment

Create your personal environment configuration file by copying the example file.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Now, edit the `.env` file with your favorite text editor (like `nano` or `vim`) and fill in the required values. **Important:** Use Linux-style paths (e.g., `/home/user/projects`).

```bash
nano .env
```

### Step 5: Run the Installer

Execute the main installation script. It will automatically detect that you are on Linux and run the correct setup. The script will likely ask for your `sudo` password to install system-wide packages.

```bash
bash scripts/install/install.sh
```

### Step 6: Restart WSL

After the installation is complete, you **must restart your WSL instance** for the Docker permissions to take effect. Close the WSL terminal and run the following command in Windows PowerShell or Command Prompt:

```powershell
wsl --shutdown
```

Then, simply reopen your WSL terminal.

### Step 7: Verify the Installation

Once you've restarted WSL, navigate back to the project directory and run the health check script to ensure everything was installed correctly.

```bash
cd portable-dev-environment
bash scripts/utils/health-check.sh
```

If all checks pass, your portable development environment is ready to use inside WSL!

 Perfect for AI-assisted development right from the command line!

## üîÑ Continuous Integration & Deployment

This repository is equipped with GitHub Actions for automated CI/CD:

*   **Continuous Integration (CI)**: On every push or pull request to `main`, a workflow builds the Docker image, scans it for vulnerabilities, and runs tests.
*   **Continuous Deployment (CD)**: When changes are merged to `main`, the Docker image is automatically published to the GitHub Container Registry.

This ensures that the `latest` tag of the Docker image is always up-to-date with the latest secure and tested version of the environment.

## üß™ Automated Testing

This repository includes a testing framework to ensure the reliability and correctness of the environment. The tests are located in the `tests/` directory and are divided into two types:

*   **Unit Tests**: These tests verify the functionality of individual scripts. They use the `shunit2` framework and can be found in `tests/unit/`.
*   **Integration Tests**: These tests verify that the entire environment works as expected. They build a test Docker image and run checks inside it. These are located in `tests/integration/`.

**To run the tests:**

```bash
# Run all unit tests
for test in tests/unit/*_test.sh; do bash "$test"; done

# Run integration tests
docker build -f tests/integration/Dockerfile.test .
```

The tests are also run automatically as part of the CI/CD pipeline.
 
 ## Enhanced AI Capabilities with MCP Servers


This environment is pre-configured with several Model-centric Communication Protocol (MCP) servers to supercharge your AI-assisted development workflow. These servers allow the OpenCode AI agent to perform a wide range of tasks automatically:

| MCP Server       | Purpose                                                                                   |
| :--------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`filesystem`** | Provides access to the local filesystem for reading, writing, and modifying files.        |
| **`git`**        | Enables interaction with Git repositories for committing, pushing, and managing branches. |
| **`fetch`**      | Allows the agent to access and retrieve information from the web.                         |
| **`context7`**   | Provides up-to-date documentation for various libraries and frameworks.                   |
| **`github`**     | Interacts with the GitHub CLI to manage repositories, issues, and pull requests.          |

| **`database`**   | Interacts with your project's database for querying data and managing schemas.            |

### Development and Production Profiles

This environment comes with two pre-configured profiles for the OpenCode AI agent:

*   `opencode.development.json`: Enables **all** MCP servers, including experimental ones. Ideal for testing new features and working on the environment itself.
*   `opencode.production.json`: Enables only the core, stable MCP servers. Optimized for performance and reliability in your daily coding tasks.

**To switch between profiles, simply copy the one you want to use to `opencode.json`:**

```bash
# To use the production profile (recommended for daily use)
cp opencode.production.json opencode.json

# To use the development profile
cp opencode.development.json opencode.json
```

The `opencode.json` file is what the OpenCode agent will load. This file is in `.gitignore`, so your choice of profile won't be committed.

## üê≥ **Complete Docker Guide**

### **Docker Basics**

Docker lets you run applications in isolated containers. Think of it like lightweight virtual machines.

- **Image** = Blueprint (like a recipe)
- **Container** = Running instance (like the actual meal)
- **Dockerfile** = Instructions to build an image
- **Docker Hub** = Online library of images

### **Essential Docker Commands**

#### **Working with Images**

```bash
# Download an image
docker pull ubuntu

# List downloaded images
docker images

# Build an image from Dockerfile
docker build -t my-app .

# Remove an image
docker rmi image-name
```

#### **Working with Containers**

```bash
# Run a container (creates and starts)
docker run hello-world

# List running containers
docker ps

# List all containers (running and stopped)
docker ps -a

# Stop a container
docker stop container-name

# Remove a container
docker rm container-name

# Run container in background (-d = detached)
docker run -d nginx

# Run with port mapping (host:container)
docker run -p 8080:80 nginx

# Run with volume mount (persist data)
docker run -v /host/path:/container/path nginx
```

### **Using This Development Environment**

#### **Option A: Docker Compose (Recommended)**
